# Crowdfunding_ETL

This project tasked us with building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After we transform the data, we'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, weâ€™ll upload the CSV files data into a Postgres database.

the four main sections of the project are as follows

1.Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
This was where we needed to read the csv file and create two databases based on teh information from the original csv
2.Create the Campaign DataFrame
This was where we created the database with the greatest amount of information and organized the information
3.Create the Contacts DataFrame
Here we were tasked with either using pandas or Regex to create a database. I used the regex option as i found it to be a better fit for myself.
4.Create the Crowdfunding Database
Lastly, we needed to create and ERD of the four csv files we created from the above steps and run then through pgadmin (SQL).
